Light HTTP1.1 Client
--------------------

This API is a wrapper around the standard java.net.URL capability for
making HTTP requests. It has the following objectives:

 * Light-weight - not much code and fast performance

 * Simple to use - provides easy programmatic HTTP client calls, handling
   the necessary headers and body data.

 * (Mostly) complete implementation - all HTTP methods and headers are
   supported.

It is written in Scala but can be called (less-easily) from Java also.
